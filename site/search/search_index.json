This is fundamental for creating realistic and visually appealing 3D scenes. The Layer Projection functionality in Philogix PBR Panter provides users with the ability to control how textures, colors, and other visual elements are applied to 3D models. By manipulating the Layer Projection settings, designers and artists can achieve various effects, such as mapping intricate textures onto complex surfaces, ensuring seamless blending between different layers, and achieving accurate representation of materials on diverse geometries.</p>"},{"location":"Layer%20Projection/#projection-layout","title":"Projection layout","text":""},{"location":"Layer%20System/channel_layer/","title":"Channel Layer","text":""},{"location":"Layer%20System/channel_layer/#layer-system","title":"Layer System","text":""},{"location":"Layer%20System/channel_layer/#updating","title":"Updating...","text":""},{"location":"Layer%20System/layer_mask/","title":"Layer Mask","text":""},{"location":"Layer%20System/layer_mask/#pbr-channel","title":"PBR Channel","text":""},{"location":"Layer%20System/layer_mask/#updating","title":"Updating...","text":""},{"location":"Layer%20System/managing_layers/","title":"Managing Layers","text":""},{"location":"Layer%20System/managing_layers/#managing-layers","title":"Managing Layers","text":""},{"location":"Layer%20System/managing_layers/#updating","title":"Updating...","text":""},{"location":"Layer%20System/material_layer/","title":"Material Layer","text":""},{"location":"Layer%20System/material_layer/#layer-system","title":"Layer System","text":""},{"location":"Layer%20System/material_layer/#updating","title":"Updating...","text":""},{"location":"Layer%20System/overview/","title":"Overview","text":""},{"location":"Layer%20System/overview/#layer-system","title":"Layer System","text":""},{"location":"Layer%20System/overview/#overview","title":"Overview","text":"<p> The Layer System allows you to manipulate the layers of a material.
