# Layer Projection


## Overview

In Philogix PBR Panter, each layer is equipped with a specialized feature called Layer Projection. This essential component plays a crucial role in the realm of 3D graphics by determining the specific method through which a layer is mapped or projected onto a three-dimensional object.

In the context of 3D graphics, Projection refers to the process of transforming a two-dimensional image or texture onto a three-dimensional surface. This is fundamental for creating realistic and visually appealing 3D scenes. The Layer Projection functionality in Philogix PBR Panter provides users with the ability to control how textures, colors, and other visual elements are applied to 3D models. By manipulating the Layer Projection settings, designers and artists can achieve various effects, such as mapping intricate textures onto complex surfaces, ensuring seamless blending between different layers, and achieving accurate representation of materials on diverse geometries.
