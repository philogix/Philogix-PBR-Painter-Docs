# Layer System


## Overview
![Alt text](<../assets/Layer System/overview.jpg>)<br>
The Layer System allows you to manipulate the layers of a material. Within a material, there are material layers, where the upper layer overlays the lower one, and the visible area is defined by the layer mask. In each material layer, there are PBR channels, with each channel specifying a characteristic of that material layer. Within the PBR channels, you can add additional channel layers, toggle the visibility of layers, adjust their opacity, and change their blending modes.
